/// A NIPK showing correct non-blinded issuance.
///
/// # Inputs
///
/// Secrets:
///
/// * `x0, x1, x2` are the `SignalIssuer`'s private key material.
/// * `x0_tilde` is a blinding factor for the secret key.
/// * `m1x1` is the message `m1` multiplied by the secret key `x1`.
/// * `m2x2` is the message `m2` multiplied by the secret key `x2`.
///
/// Publics:
///
/// * `u` is the aMAC nonce.
/// * `Cx0` is a Pedersen commitment to the secret key `x0`.
/// * `B` and `A` are generators of the group, where `A` is chosen orthogonally
///   such that `log_B(A)` is intractible.
/// * `X1, X2` are the issuer's public key material.
/// * `u_prime` is the aMAC tag.
//
// TODO The "m1x1" is `m1*x1` and is a hack because the zkp crate doesn't
// currently support multiplying to scalars together before multiplying them by
// the public point, so we multiply them before passing them into the
// macro-generated code as an additional secret value (since it depend on x1).
