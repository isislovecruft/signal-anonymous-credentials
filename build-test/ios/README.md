 iOS
=====

This is test code for determining the complexity of building/running
cryptographic Rust code for iOS clients.


 Usage
-------

Install Xcode build tools:

```sh
xcode-select --install
```

Install `rustup` either via brew or via the rustup shell script:

```sh
brew install rustup-init && rustup-init
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

Add the iOS architectures to rustup so we can use them during cross
compilation:

```sh
rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios armv7-apple-ios armv7s-apple-ios x86_64-apple-ios i386-apple-ios
```

Use cargo (Rust's package manager) to install `cargo-lipo`. This is a
cargo subcommand which automatically creates a universal library for
use with iOS. Without this crate, cross compiling Rust to work on iOS
is infinitely harder.

```sh
cargo install cargo-lipo
```

Now build with lipo:

```sh
cargo lipo --release
```

There should now be a universal iOS library at `target/universal/release/libbuildtest.a`.



Notes
-----

I followed roughly
[this post](https://mozilla.github.io/firefox-browser-architecture/experiments/2017-09-06-rust-on-ios.html).

There's currently
[a bug](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/36156#issuecomment-330971277)
in rustc that prevents building for iOS from anything but macOS.  This
should be too much of an issue since we also need to use Xcode, which
only works on macOS anyway.
